## Bio

I am a senior designer and design thought leadership lead at Capco, a global financial services consultancy. I have experience working with a wide range of clients, from financial corporations to start-ups.

My background in psychology and human-computer interaction empowers me to capture behaviour patterns from quantitative and qualitative research. Workplace user experience excites me and I thrive on crafting holistic, surface-to-core experiences for people both internal and external of organisations.

I am a returning speaker on UX Crunch (Tech Circus) on designing and researching in the financial services sector. In addition to my work, I am a <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/christie-lau" target="_blank">design mentor on ADPlist</a>, an award-winning <a href="https://skl.sh/2TOE5Qc" target="_blank">Skillshare teacher</a>, and an urban gardener.


## My journey <span>&#x26F5;</span>

I graduated in BSc Psychology in 2012 and MSc Human-Computer Interaction with Ergonomics in 2015, both at UCL. I worked in different areas in business, from design to marketing between my two degrees. After my master degree, I grew my design and research repertoire while working with a wide range of clients. Recently I have joined Capco and trained over 80 clients from tier-1 global banks on design thinking.

My empirical psychology background and my experience in business and marketing drive my design process. I conduct user research using qualitative and quantitative methods. Then I provide tested design products and services that address user needs and business KPIs. Workplace user experience excites me and I thrive on crafting holistic, surface-to-core experiences for both internal and external users.

> To me, user experience (UX) includes UI, product, interaction, and service design. (I'm in Don Norman's camp of UX definition.)
