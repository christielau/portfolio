## My work

Current client: Global insurer (since February 2022)

I'm designing a brand new banking proposition, helping people to manage their money well and reduce their carbon footprint at the same time.

Alonside my project, I help raise awareness of design within Capco and run design thinking trainings. Recently I'm writing design blog posts.


## Outside of work
I'm a mentor on <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/christie-lau" target="_blank">ADPlist</a> and I enjoy meeting with people who're new to the industry about design and career.If you would like a chat about design career, feel free to get in touch.

Open to new opportunities. <span>&#128075;</span>

Regularly riding my Brompton <span>&#128690;</span> for a healthier post-pandemic lifestyle while reducing our carbon footprint.

## Current interest
* Design workplace experiences to change people’s work-life from core to surface
* Design beyond human-centred design: planet-centric design
* Empathise with people via research and participatory methods
* Make sense of chaos: information architecture and system design
* Reduce food waste and one-off, disposable waste

### What I want to do more of
* Design-driven social impact and social enterprise
* New interaction methods: Spatial design and Tangible user interfaces

## I would love to...
* Speak at your event ([See my previous talks](/talks-and-workshops))
* Run workshops
* Become a advisor at hackathon / design jam
* Join a charity board
