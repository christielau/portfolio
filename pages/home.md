# Strive to design a better future for humanity and the planet <span>	&#127759;</span>
###### ↑ Rather bold statement summing up what I aspire in my career



Hi, I’m Christie, a product designer (UX) based in London. I solve problems for people and businesses via design. My background in psychology and human-computer interaction strengthens my evidence-driven design approach. <span>&#x1F481;&#x200D;&#x2640;&#xFE0F;</span>

> My class  <a href="https://skl.sh/2TOE5Qc" target="_blank">"How to Create a Storyboard: Bring Your Product/Service Concept to Life in 20 minutes"</a> has won the grand prize in the Skillshare Contest for First Time Business and Technology Teachers.

I see my personal website (this one you're looking at right now <span>&#128521;</span>) as my playground for learning to code. I code this website using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank"> Eleventy</a>. Still very far from what I've got on my design sketches, getting there.
