# Christie's portfolio

I used Eleventy Netlify Boilerplate created by Dan Urbanowicz as a starter for my design portfolio.
URL: https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate.git


## What is Eleventy Netlify Boilerplate?

A simple template for building a fast, static website using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) static site generator, with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) baked-in, ready to deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) in a couple of clicks.


## Usage

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate&stack=cms)

Netlify team in the [Netlify CMS Gitter](https://gitter.im/netlify/netlifycms).

```
npm install
```

### 5. Run Eleventy (builds the site)

```
npx eleventy
```

Or build automatically when a template changes:
```
npx eleventy --watch
```

Or in debug mode:
```
DEBUG=* npx eleventy
```
